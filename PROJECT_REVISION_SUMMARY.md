# Project Revision Summary ‚Äî Ready for Your Decision

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: ‚úÖ Planning Complete ‚Äî Awaiting Your Approval to Begin

---

## üìã What We Discussed

You clarified that the contractor's original plan didn't match your vision in several key areas:

### ‚ùå Original Misunderstandings
1. **Copy/paste text flow** ‚Üí You never wanted this
2. **Local-first only** ‚Üí You're fine with cloud backend
3. **Custom everything** ‚Üí You prefer existing libraries where they work
4. **No content discovery** ‚Üí Discovery is KEY to your vision

### ‚úÖ Your Actual Vision
1. **Web app curates articles** ‚Üí Recommends "just right" difficulty content
2. **Extension enhances reading** ‚Üí Users read on real websites, extension highlights unknowns
3. **Discovery is critical** ‚Üí Help learners find appropriate, interesting content
4. **Cloud backend is fine** ‚Üí Privacy-focused, but multi-device and data safety matter
5. **Use existing tools** ‚Üí Don't reinvent wheels (tokenizer, SRS, etc.)

## üéØ Recommended Approach (Revised Plan)

### **What We're Building**

**Two-Component System**:

1. **Web App** (Discovery Platform)
   - User signup and onboarding
   - Personalized article feed (matched to user's level + interests)
   - Progress dashboard (words learned, reading streak)
   - Reading history
   - 20-30 curated articles for MVP

2. **Browser Extension** (Reading Assistant)
   - Activates when user clicks "Read" on an article
   - Highlights unknown words on real websites
   - Sidebar shows pre-read vocabulary
   - Tooltips with pinyin + definitions on hover
   - Syncs reading data back to web app

### **Key Technologies**

- **Frontend**: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript 5
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **Segmentation**: jieba-wasm (proven Chinese word tokenizer)
- **Dictionary**: CC-CEDICT (115k entries, open license)
- **Extension**: Manifest V3 (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo + pnpm
- **Cost**: $5-10/month (free tier for first 1000+ users)

### **Timeline to MVP**

- **Phase 0** (1 week): Proof-of-concept
  - Extension that segments text and highlights unknowns
  - Test with 2-3 learners for validation

- **Phase 1** (5-6 weeks): Full MVP
  - User accounts, onboarding, mastery tracking
  - Article discovery feed with recommendations
  - Polished extension UI with tooltips and sidebar
  - Progress dashboard
  - 20-30 curated articles

- **Total**: 6-7 weeks to MVP (vs 8-11 in original plan)

---

## ‚úÖ Why This Approach is Better

1. **Aligns with your vision**: Discovery + extension-based reading (not copy/paste)
2. **Faster**: 4-5 weeks faster to MVP by using existing libraries
3. **More scalable**: Cloud backend enables recommendations, multi-device, analytics
4. **Lower risk**: Proven technologies (jieba, Supabase) instead of custom implementations
5. **Easier to maintain**: Less custom code means less debugging
6. **Better UX**: Reading on real websites (drives traffic to sources) vs isolated app

---

## üìä Smart Cuts (Deferred to Later Phases)

### Moved to Phase 2+
- ‚ùå HSK 3.0 alignment (not core to MVP)
- ‚ùå Traditional Chinese support (90%+ of users need Simplified)
- ‚ùå Automated content crawling (manual curation faster for MVP)

### Moved to Phase 3
- ‚ùå Active SRS flashcard reviews (passive tracking sufficient for MVP)
- ‚ùå Advanced segmentation (jieba is "good enough" for MVP)

### Still in MVP ‚úÖ
- User accounts and cloud storage ‚úÖ
- Article discovery and recommendations ‚úÖ
- Browser extension with highlighting ‚úÖ
- Tooltips and sidebar ‚úÖ
- Progress dashboard ‚úÖ
- 20-30 curated articles ‚úÖ

## üí∞ Cost Breakdown

| Service | Free Tier | Paid (if needed) |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Supabase | 50k rows, 500MB storage, 2GB bandwidth | $25/month (generous limits) |
| Vercel | Unlimited deployments | $0 (free tier sufficient) |

## üöÄ Your Next Decision

### **Option 1: Proceed with Revised Plan** ‚≠ê (RECOMMENDED)

**What happens next**:
1. Follow [QUICK_START_GUIDE.md](QUICK_START_GUIDE.md) for Day 1 setup
2. I guide you through Phase 0 (1 week) step-by-step
3. Build proof-of-concept extension
4. Test with 2-3 Chinese learners
5. If validated ‚Üí Continue to MVP
6. If not ‚Üí Pivot based on feedback

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Fast validation (1 week)
- ‚úÖ Low risk ($0 investment if idea doesn't work)
- ‚úÖ Aligns with your vision
- ‚úÖ Uses your preferred approach (cloud backend, existing libraries)

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires learning Supabase (but I'll help)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è $5 Chrome Web Store fee (minimal)

---

### **Option 2: Hybrid Approach**

Mix and match from original and revised plans based on your preferences.

**Discuss**:
- Which specific technologies you want to keep/change
- Which features you want in MVP vs later phases
- Any concerns about the revised approach

---

### **Option 3: Stick with Original Plan**

Follow contractor's plan with custom implementations.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ More control over every component
- ‚úÖ No vendor lock-in (Supabase)

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå 4-5 weeks slower
- ‚ùå More custom code to maintain
- ‚ùå Higher risk (custom tokenizer may not work well)
- ‚ùå Doesn't match your vision (copy/paste instead of discovery)

---

## ‚ùì Open Questions (Need Your Answers)

Before starting, I need to know:

1. **Approval**: Do you approve the revised plan?
2. **Content curation**: For MVP, can you help curate 20-30 good Chinese articles? (Provide URLs, I'll analyze them)
3. **Design**: Are you okay with using default Shadcn/ui components, or do you want custom design?
4. **Testing**: Do you have 2-3 Chinese learner friends who can test the POC in Week 1?
5. **Domain**: Do you have a domain name in mind? (e.g., `chinesereadingpal.com`)
