## ðŸ“¦ Contents

### `contractor-artifacts/`
Original skeleton code and examples provided by the contractor. These were conceptual illustrations and are not being used in the revised implementation.

**Contents**:
- `algorithms/` â€” Original tokenizer and difficulty scorer stubs
- `web-app-skeleton/` â€” Next.js skeleton structure
- `Data_Schema/` â€” JSON schemas (concepts still valid, but implementation differs)
- `ux/` â€” Wireframes and UX notes

**Why archived**:
- We're using jieba-wasm instead of custom tokenizer
- We're using Vite + React instead of Next.js skeleton
- Extension-first approach instead of web-first paste-text approach

**Still useful for**: Understanding original thinking and conceptual data models

### `superseded-planning/`
First iteration of planning documents that were created before the project vision was clarified.

**Contents**:
- `implementation_plan.md` â€” Original 18-22 week plan (superseded by REVISED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- `tech_stack.md` â€” Original tech choices (superseded by REVISED_TECH_STACK.md)
- `current_task.md` â€” Old task tracking (will be recreated when development starts)
- `changelog.md` â€” Old changelog (will be recreated when development starts)
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` â€” Old status summary (superseded by PROJECT_REVISION_SUMMARY.md)

**Why archived**:
- Based on misunderstanding of product vision (copy/paste text flow)
- Slower timeline due to custom implementations
- Local-first only architecture (revised to cloud-based)

**Still useful for**: Seeing the evolution of thinking and what changed
