## 🎯 The Vision (In Plain English)

**Problem**: Chinese learners struggle to find articles at the right difficulty level and need help with unknown words while reading.

**Solution**:
1. **Web app recommends** articles matched to user's level (90-95% known words = "just right")
2. **Browser extension helps** while reading on real websites (highlights unknowns, shows definitions)
3. **Progress tracking** shows words learned, reading streak, estimated HSK level

**Key Insight**: Discovery is critical — learners don't know where to find good content.

## ✅ What's Different from Original Plan?

| Original (Contractor) | Revised (Your Vision) |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Paste text into web app | Extension on real websites |
| Local-only (IndexedDB) | Cloud backend (Supabase) |
| Custom tokenizer | Use jieba library |
| Next.js | Vite + React (simpler) |
| 18-22 weeks | 14-17 weeks |
| No content discovery | Discovery is KEY |

**Bottom line**: Revised plan better matches your actual vision and is faster to build.

- Article feed (personalized recommendations)
- Progress dashboard
- 20-30 curated articles for MVP

**2. Browser Extension** (Reading Assistant)
- Highlights unknown words on any Chinese website
- Sidebar with vocabulary list
- Tooltips with definitions and pinyin
- Syncs data with web app

## 🚦 Your Next Step

### If You Approve the Revised Plan:

1. **Say**: "Approved, let's start Phase 0"
2. **Then follow**: [QUICK_START_GUIDE.md](QUICK_START_GUIDE.md)
3. **Time needed**: 2-3 hours for Day 1 setup
4. **I'll help with**: Every step, troubleshooting, questions

### If You Have Questions:

**Ask about anything**:
- Technology choices (Why Supabase? Why Vite?)
- Timeline concerns (Can we go faster/slower?)
- Cost implications (What if we get 10,000 users?)
- Specific features (Can we add X in MVP?)

**Where to look**:
- Technical details → [REVISED_TECH_STACK.md](REVISED_TECH_STACK.md)
- Task breakdown → [REVISED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](REVISED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- Comparison → [COMPARISON_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md](COMPARISON_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)

### If You Want to Modify the Plan:

**Tell me**:
- Which technologies you want to change
