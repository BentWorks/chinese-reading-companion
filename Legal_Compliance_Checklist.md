# Legal & Compliance Checklist (Non-Legal Advice)

## Content Access
- Prefer **client-side analysis** with no server copies of third-party articles.
- If providing a Reader proxy:
  - Check robots.txt and site ToS; respect disallow.
  - Fetch for **ephemeral, personal use**; do not cache full text beyond session.
  - Prominently link back to source; avoid stripping ads/paywalls.
  - Consider **embed/iframe** only where allowed; remove if requested by publisher.

## Licensing
- **CC-CEDICT**: keep attribution visible; share modifications per license terms.
- **HSK lists**: confirm redistribution; if unclear, store only IDs/levels or link to official docs.
- **Example sentences**: use permissive sources (e.g., Tatoeba with attribution); avoid proprietary dictionaries.
- **Frequency data**: verify license for redistribution (e.g., SUBTLEX-CH terms).

## User Data
- Local-first; explicit consent for any sync.
- Provide export (JSON) and permanent delete.
- Post-social: moderation policy, reporting tools, and clear community license for UGC (e.g., CC BY-NC-SA).

## TTS & Audio
- On-device first; cloud TTS only with proper terms; no redistributing voices if prohibited.

## Trademarks & Logos
- Only use with permission or plain text names.
